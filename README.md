# EvePIConverter
Simple(ish) Script that Converts an Extraction planet between PlanetTypes


Update Sample.json with the export from your PI Template. 
Run Process.ps1
NewSample.json will be created with changes as you have configured


## Assumptions

- Factory Planets aren't currently supported, though theoretically if only up to P2 would work. 
- You will still need to find the best place to drop your template on the planet you want, and may need to move your extractors + extractor heads, potnetially re-creating your route from the Extractors to your Launchpad
